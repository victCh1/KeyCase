# KeyCase
KeyCase is a simple program for storing logins and passwords
or various keys.
In the current version, the information is stored in the program
directory in open form, but in the future it is planned to implement 
protection of the data from unwanted viewing.
Logins/passwords/keys are added and edited via dialog boxes and 
they are copied to the clipboard and removed from the clipboard by 
clicking on the appropriate context icons.
The program allows to set/remove the masking mode both globally
for all records and for each record individually.
